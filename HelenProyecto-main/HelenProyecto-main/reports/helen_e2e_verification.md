# HELEN E2E Verification Report (Container Environment)

## Summary
- Backend `backendHelen.server` boots correctly using the synthetic classifier and dataset bundled in the repository, and exposes `/healthz` with a `HEALTHY` status while streaming events over SSE.
- Automated test suite (`pytest`) passes, covering backend API, frontend structure and model pipeline unit checks.
- The evaluation environment lacks camera devices, graphical stack, and Raspberry Pi hardware acceleration, so live MediaPipe/XGBoost capture and Chromium kiosk verification could not be exercised.
- **Real Raspberry Pi / Debian Bookworm validation could not be performed in this container-only workspace.** No evidence has been gathered that the production model, camera pipeline, Chromium kiosk frontend, or activation ring operate correctly on hardware.

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (container).  
- CPU: 3 vCPUs (`Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8370C`).  
- GPU: Not exposed inside container.  
- Camera devices: none present under `/dev/video*`.  
- Network: outbound HTTPS allowed (used by `curl`).

## Checklist
| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OS / hardware inventory | ⚠️ | Verified generic container specs; not Raspberry Pi / Debian Bookworm. |
| Dependency installation | ⚠️ | Repository ships lightweight `SimpleGestureClassifier`; heavy dependencies (MediaPipe, XGBoost) not installed. |
| Camera access | ❌ | No V4L2 devices available in container. |
| Backend start | ✅ | `python -m backendHelen.server` listening on `0.0.0.0:5000`. |
| `/healthz` endpoint | ✅ | Reports `model_loaded=True`, `pipeline_running=True`, `status="HEALTHY"`. |
| SSE stream | ✅ | Warm-up event + continuous gesture payloads received. |
| Frontend (Chromium kiosk) | ❌ | GUI stack/browser unavailable; not exercised. |
| Activation ring UX | ⚠️ | Reviewed source; no runtime validation possible without browser. |
| Latency measurement | ⚠️ | Synthetic latency only (~0.08 ms); no real camera pipeline. |
| Resource monitoring (CPU/RAM/FPS/Temp) | ❌ | Not measurable without real hardware & sensors. |
| Autostart/resilience | ❌ | Systemd/pm2 setup not validated. |

## Requested Real-Hardware Validation (Unfulfilled)

The latest user request requires confirmation on actual Raspberry Pi hardware with a physical camera and Chromium kiosk. Those tasks remain **unexecuted** because the container environment provides no access to the necessary devices or operating system stack. Explicit responses:

| Confirmation requested | Result | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend & frontend running together without errors on hardware | ❌ Not verified | Chromium/browser stack is not present; no way to launch the kiosk frontend alongside Flask inside the container. |
| Model responding to real gestures from camera | ❌ Not verified | No `/dev/video*` devices or GPU/CPU optimisations for MediaPipe/XGBoost; camera capture cannot be initiated. |
| System 100% functional in final environment | ❌ Not verified | None of the hardware-specific checkpoints (camera latency, activation ring behaviour, reconnection) can be exercised. |

To complete these validations, rerun the checklist on a Raspberry Pi (Debian/Bookworm) with the production dependencies installed, a V4L2-compatible camera connected, and Chromium available in kiosk mode. Capture logs, resource metrics, browser console output, and end-to-end gesture traces as outlined in the request.

## Commands Executed
```bash
python -m backendHelen.server
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/healthz | jq
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:5000/events
pytest -q
cat /etc/os-release
lscpu | head
ls /dev/video*
```

## Logs & Observations
- Backend startup & shutdown:
  - `[2025-10-21 07:11:27,366] INFO Gesture pipeline started`
  - `[2025-10-21 07:11:27,367] INFO HELEN backend serving from 0.0.0.0:5000`
  - `...`
- `/healthz` response (abridged):
  ```json
  {
    "status": "HEALTHY",
    "model_loaded": true,
    "pipeline_running": true,
    "last_prediction": {
      "gesture": "0",
      "score": 0.9133,
      "latency_ms": 0.085
    }
  }
  ```
- SSE sample payload:
  ```text
  data: {"session_id": "…", "sequence": 10, "timestamp": "2025-10-21T07:11:36.373375+00:00", "gesture": "0", "score": 0.9223, "latency_ms": 0.13, "source": "pipeline", "numeric": true}
  ```

## Outstanding Gaps / Risks
- Real-time capture via MediaPipe/OpenCV and the original XGBoost model are not validated; only the synthetic classifier provided in `Hellen_model_RN/simple_classifier.py` is exercised.
- No confirmation of Chromium kiosk behaviour, prefers-reduced-motion compliance, or activation ring UX beyond static code review.
- Absence of camera prevents measuring FPS, latency (<200 ms), reconnection behaviour, or verifying activation ring completion with real gestures.
- Autostart scripts (`systemd`, `pm2`, etc.) were not deployed.

## Recommendations
1. Re-run the verification on target Raspberry Pi hardware with a V4L2-compatible camera and Chromium in kiosk mode.
2. Install full dependency stack (`mediapipe`, `opencv-python`, `xgboost`) and replace the synthetic classifier with the production model to validate actual gesture recognition.
3. Capture resource metrics (CPU, RAM, GPU, temperature) via `htop`, `vcgencmd`, or equivalent tools on the Pi during a 3+ minute run.
4. Validate frontend accessibility features and animation timing directly in the kiosk browser, collecting console logs and screenshots.
5. Configure and exercise autostart/resilience scripts under the real init system.
