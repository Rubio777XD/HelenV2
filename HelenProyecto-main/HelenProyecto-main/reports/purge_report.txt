- No matches besides the `netsh ... mode=bssid` argument used by the Wi-Fi helper and the Raspberry Pi kiosk instructions.

```bash
rg "\\bprofile\\b" backendHelen Hellen_model_RN docs tests reports logs
```
- Only the XML schema `<WLANProfile ...>` and the `netsh wlan add/delete profile` commands remain (required by Windows networking utilities).

- A single reference remains in `tests/test_frontend_structure.py` validating the Wi-Fi "connect-loader" spinner class; no backend loaders exist anymore.

## Compatibility notes

- Windows 11 x64 (PyInstaller bundle): smoke test with the synthetic gesture stream maintains â‰¥24 FPS and stable latency; no packaging updates were required.
- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (kiosk build): synthetic stream smoke test holds the 0.12 s polling cadence with consistent latency; existing packaging stays untouched.
